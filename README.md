# AspDotNetVidzy
This repository is a tricked out version of the project from a Udemy course by Mosh Hamedani called "The Complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course". I have developed this project using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. I am using Visual Studio Code, and installed .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework.Core. The Entity Framework ORM is connected to PostreSQL instead of SQL Server.
